of any rockets, nothing.

1766
01:41:19,449 --> 01:41:20,742
They searched everything.
They couldn’t find it.

1767
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:22,535
They had to have
gotten here somehow.

1768
01:41:22,619 --> 01:41:24,370
Exactly. All we know is...

1769
01:41:25,455 --> 01:41:27,832
...they were just here.

1770
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:30,460
Just because
they attacked in 2048

1771
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:32,003
doesn’t mean that’s
when they got here.

1772
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:33,963
What if they got here
in ’47, ’46?

1773
01:41:34,047 --> 01:41:35,590
I mean, it’s
the middle of nowhere, Russia.

1774
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:36,800
We wouldn’t have found
their ships.

1775
01:41:36,883 --> 01:41:39,344

at the wrong year.

1776
01:41:42,931 --> 01:41:44,599

1778
01:41:47,894 --> 01:41:49,729
Who are you gonna tell them
came up with the solution?

1779
01:41:49,813 --> 01:41:51,731
From me. I’m gonna definitely
say that I came up with it.

1780
01:41:51,815 --> 01:41:54,400
-I think it was your wife.
-It’s all good. It’s all good.

to stop rioting

1783
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:03,034
and looting from spreading
across the globe,

1784
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:04,953

in 30 years,

1785
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:08,039

the face of the earth.

I was trying to save
my daughter.

1798

1799

CHARLIE:
Well, there is something here.

1805
01:43:06,055 --> 01:43:07,724
But it’s not sediment.

1806
01:43:09,392 --> 01:43:11,978
Or blood.

1807
01:43:13,146 --> 01:43:16,566
It’s ash. It’s volcanic ash.

1808
01:43:16,649 --> 01:43:19,402
And it’s not from Russia.
It’s from China.

1809
01:43:19,485 --> 01:43:22,113
-Or Korea. Somewhere in there.
-How do you know that?

1810
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:24,908
Oh, you want me to explain the
chemical makeup of the sediment?

1811
01:43:24,991 --> 01:43:26,200
Fuck no.

1812
01:43:26,284 --> 01:43:28,161
So, how does
Chinese volcanic ash end up

1813
01:43:28,244 --> 01:43:29,621
on an island in northern Russia?

1814
01:43:29,704 --> 01:43:31,706
You know any volcano experts?

1815
01:43:35,418 --> 01:43:37,420
Am I in trouble?

1816
01:43:37,503 --> 01:43:40,256
Martin, the lives of every man,

1817
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:43,384
woman and child on this planet
could be saved

1818
01:43:43,468 --> 01:43:45,845
if we could just get the answer
to one question,

1819
01:43:45,929 --> 01:43:48,097
and it’s all about volcanoes.

1820
01:43:48,181 --> 01:43:49,974
I knew this would happen.

1821
01:43:50,058 --> 01:43:53,102
Oh, I would’ve killed for a
moment like this in high school.

1822
01:43:53,186 --> 01:43:55,146
How would a creature

1823
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:57,565
who’s only ever stepped foot
in northern Russia

1824
01:43:57,649 --> 01:44:00,693
get volcanic ash from China
or Korea under its claws?

1825
01:44:00,777 --> 01:44:05,740
Well, this would be weird,
but...

1826
01:44:05,823 --> 01:44:08,576
it would have to be from
the Millennium Eruption.

1827
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:09,953
The Millennium Eruption.

1828
01:44:10,036 --> 01:44:11,412
What the hell is that?

1829
01:44:11,496 --> 01:44:14,040
The Changbai volcano
on the border

1830
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:17,710
of China and Korea
erupted in 946 A.D.

1831
01:44:17,794 --> 01:44:21,422
with the force of over
a thousand nuclear bombs.

1832
01:44:21,506 --> 01:44:23,132
It blew ash over half the world,

1833
01:44:23,216 --> 01:44:26,260
and today, you can still find
that ash buried in ice.

1834
01:44:26,344 --> 01:44:27,637
Is there any way to pinpoint

1835
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:29,514
exactly where in Russia
that ash would’ve landed?

1836
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:31,140
-(snaps fingers)
-Laptop.

1837
01:44:31,224 --> 01:44:32,976
(students murmuring)

1838
01:44:33,059 --> 01:44:34,519
I love this kid.

1839
01:44:37,355 --> 01:44:39,065
Thanks.

1840
01:44:42,402 --> 01:44:44,153
Check this out.

1841
01:44:44,237 --> 01:44:46,072
This is the largest glacier
in Russia.

1842
01:44:46,155 --> 01:44:48,449
Scientists doing
deep drill experiments there

1843
01:44:48,533 --> 01:44:51,452
found volcanic ash
at a depth of 400 meters,

1844
01:44:51,536 --> 01:44:54,580
a depth consistent
with the average snowfall

1845
01:44:54,664 --> 01:44:57,000
since the year 946 A.D.

1846
01:44:57,083 --> 01:44:59,210
But to get ash
in the claws, I mean,

1847
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:02,171
they would have to dig through
a thousand years of ice.

1848
01:45:03,423 --> 01:45:05,341
They didn’t dig down.
They dug up.

1849
01:45:05,425 --> 01:45:07,051
That’s why there’s
no sign of impact.

1850
01:45:07,135 --> 01:45:09,345
BOTH: They’ve been here
the whole time.

1851
01:45:10,388 --> 01:45:12,849
Why wait a thousand years
to dig out?

1852
01:45:12,932 --> 01:45:16,019
Martin, can you bring up an
ice melt projection for Russia?

1853
01:45:16,102 --> 01:45:20,231
Yeah, polar ice melt, uh,
Russia, 2023 to 2048.

1854
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:21,482
MARTIN:
There it is.

1855
01:45:21,566 --> 01:45:22,817
CHARLIE:
They didn’t wait it out.

1856
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:25,069
They thawed out.

1857
01:45:28,281 --> 01:45:30,199
We have to get to Russia.

1858
01:45:30,283 --> 01:45:33,119
(laughs):
No. You’re not going to Russia.

1859
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:35,663
-But that’s where they are.
-Well, we think.

1860
01:45:35,747 --> 01:45:37,832
No, we know.
That has to be where they are.

1861
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:39,250
Have any proof?

1862
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:40,793
We have to go there
to get the proof.

1863
01:45:40,877 --> 01:45:43,755
Listen, if we can go there now
and kill them all,

1864
01:45:43,838 --> 01:45:45,840
we prevent this from ever
happening, you understand?

1865
01:45:45,923 --> 01:45:48,176
We’ve lost all contact
with the future, Forester.

1866
01:45:48,259 --> 01:45:50,261
President just placed
the armed forces on high alert.

1867

And-and you want me to use
taxpayer money

1872
01:46:01,731 --> 01:46:05,401
to fund a special covert mission
into a hostile sovereign nation,

1873
01:46:05,485 --> 01:46:07,487

1874
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:10,239

I can tell I’m not
convincing you at all. That’s...

1877
01:46:15,328 --> 01:46:18,039
Look, guys...

1878
01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:20,583
the way things are going,

1879
01:46:20,666 --> 01:46:22,835
we’ll be lucky if we don’t
kill each other off

1880
01:46:22,919 --> 01:46:25,296
long before the aliens get here.

1881
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:27,340
Excuse me.

1882
01:46:27,423 --> 01:46:29,550
Well, I hate to say
I told you so,

1883
01:46:29,634 --> 01:46:31,594
but people just hate
spending money on research.

1884
01:46:31,677 --> 01:46:34,013
I say we just go kill ’em
ourselves. How about that, huh?

1885
01:46:34,097 --> 01:46:35,640
No, Russia’s closed its borders.

1886
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:37,809
I mean, we need a plane
and a pilot willing to commit

1887
01:46:37,892 --> 01:46:39,519
an international felony,
whatever that’s called.

1888
01:46:39,602 --> 01:46:41,938
There’s no way we can get there.

1889
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:46,275
There may be a way.

1890
01:46:59,205 --> 01:47:01,124

1891
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:04,418
Miami Dolphins still suck?

1892
01:47:04,502 --> 01:47:06,462
I need a plane.

1893
01:47:06,546 --> 01:47:08,756
And a pilot.

1894
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:11,134
To fly undetected
into Russian airspace

1895
01:47:11,217 --> 01:47:15,096
so I can get a team of soldiers
to the top of a glacier island

1896
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:17,181

O mecanismo de expressão regular corresponderá o máximo possível de caracteres em uma cadeia de caracteres de entrada possível. Quando não for mais possível corresponder, ele não fará o rastreamento inverso para tentar alternar as correspondências de padrão. (Ou seja, a subexpressão corresponderá somente às cadeias de caracteres que seriam correspondidas pela subexpressão sozinha. Ela não tentará corresponder a uma cadeia de caracteres com base na subexpressão e nas subexpressões seguintes.)

Essa opção é recomendada quando você sabe que o rastreamento inverso não será bem-sucedido. Impedir o mecanismo de expressão regular de executar pesquisas desnecessárias melhora o desempenho.grupo atômico/Corresponde a um caractere de backspace, \u0008caractere de backspace	Uma definição de grupo de balanceamento exclui a definição de um grupo definido anteriormente e armazena, no grupo atual, o intervalo entre o grupo definido anteriormente e o grupo atual.
    
'name1' é o grupo atual (opcional), 'name2' é um grupo definido anteriormente e 'subexpression' é qualquer padrão de expressão regular válido. A definição de grupo de balanceamento exclui a definição de name2 e armazena o intervalo entre name2 e name1 no name1. Se não for definido nenhum name2, a correspondência retrocederá. Como a exclusão da última definição de name2 revela a definição anterior de name2, esse constructo permite o uso da pilha de capturas para o grupo name2 como um contador para manter o controle de constructos aninhados, como parênteses ou colchetes de abertura e fechamento.

A definição de grupo de balanceamento usa 'name2' como uma pilha. O caractere inicial de cada constructo aninhado é colocado no grupo e em sua coleção Group.Captures. Quando o caractere de fechamento é correspondido, seu caractere de abertura correspondente é removido do grupo e a coleção Captures é reduzida em um. Após a correspondência dos caracteres de abertura e fechamento de todas as construções aninhadas, 'name1' ficará vazio.grupo de balanceamento

'base_group' é um grupo ou intervalo de caracteres positivos ou negativos. O componente 'excluded_group' é outro grupo de caracteres positivos ou negativos ou outra expressão de subtração de classe de caracteres (ou seja, você pode aninhar expressões de subtração de classes de caracteres).#subtração de classe de caracteresgrupo de caracterescomentárioEste elemento de linguagem tenta corresponder a um de dois padrões, dependendo da possibilidade de correspondência com um padrão inicial.

Como o elemento de linguagem $, \z ignora a opção RegexOptions.Multiline. Ao contrário do elemento de linguagem \Z, \z não corresponde a um caractere \n no final de uma cadeia de caracteres. Portanto, ele só pode corresponder à última linha da cadeia de caracteres de entrada.#fim da cadeia de caracteres somenteA âncora \Z especifica que uma correspondência precisa ocorrer no final da cadeia de caracteres de entrada ou antes de \n no final da cadeia de caracteres de entrada. Ela é idêntica à âncora $, exceto que \Z ignora a opção RegexOptions.Multiline. Portanto, em uma cadeia de caracteres multilinha, ela pode corresponder somente ao final da última linha ou à última linha antes de \n.

A âncora \Z corresponde a \n, mas não corresponde à \r\n (à combinação de caracteres CR/LF). Para corresponder a CR/LF, inclua \r?\Z no padrão de expressão regular.9fim da cadeia de caracteres ou antes do fim da nova linhaA âncora $ especifica que o padrão anterior precisa ocorrer no final da cadeia de caracteres de entrada ou antes de \n no final da cadeia de caracteres de entrada. Se você usar $ com a opção RegexOptions.Multiline, a correspondência também poderá ocorrer no final de uma linha.

Se o comportamento em conformidade com o ECMAScript for especificado, \w será equivalente a [a-zA-Z_0-9]caractere de palavrasimUma asserção lookahead negativa de largura zero, em que, para que a correspondência seja bem-sucedida, a cadeia de caracteres de entrada não pode corresponder ao padrão de expressão regular na subexpressão. A cadeia de caracteres correspondente não está incluída no resultado correspondente.

Uma asserção lookahead negativa de largura zero normalmente é usada no início ou no final de uma expressão regular. No início de uma expressão regular, ela pode definir um padrão específico que não deve ser correspondido quando o início da expressão regular define um padrão semelhante, mas mais geral, a ser correspondido. Nesse caso, ela geralmente é usada para limitar o rastreamento inverso. No final de uma expressão regular, ela pode definir uma subexpressão que não pode ocorrer no final de uma correspondência.-asserção lookahead negativa de largura zeroUma asserção lookbehind negativa de largura zero, em que, para que uma correspondência seja bem-sucedida, a 'subexpression' não pode ocorrer na cadeia de caracteres de entrada à esquerda da posição atual. As substrings que não corresponderem à 'subexpression' não serão incluídas no resultado correspondente.

As declarações de lookbehind negativas de largura zero normalmente são usadas no início de expressões regulares. O padrão que elas definem impede uma correspondência na cadeia de caracteres seguinte. Elas também são usadas para limitar o rastreamento inverso quando o último caractere ou caracteres em um grupo capturado não pode ser um ou mais dos caracteres que correspondem ao padrão dessa expressão regular do grupo..asserção lookbehind negativa de largura zeroUma asserção lookahead positiva de largura zero, em que para que uma correspondência seja bem-sucedida, a cadeia de caracteres de entrada precisa corresponder ao padrão de expressão regular na 'subexpression'. A substring correspondente não é incluída no resultado correspondente. Uma asserção lookahead positiva de largura zero não retrocede.

Normalmente, uma asserção lookahead positiva de largura zero é encontrada no final de um padrão de expressão regular. Ela define uma substring que precisa ser encontrada no final de uma cadeia de caracteres para que uma correspondência ocorra, mas que não deve ser incluída na correspondência. Ela também é útil para impedir o rastreamento inverso excessivo. Você pode usar uma asserção lookahead positiva de largura zero para garantir que um determinado grupo capturado comece com um texto que corresponda a um subconjunto do padrão definido para esse grupo capturado.-asserção lookahead positiva de largura zeroUma asserção lookbehind positiva de largura zero, em que, para que uma correspondência seja bem-sucedida, a 'subexpression' precisa ocorrer na cadeia de caracteres de entrada à esquerda da posição atual. A 'subexpression' não é incluída no resultado correspondente. Uma asserção lookbehind positiva de largura zero não retrocede.

As declarações de lookbehind positivas de largura zero normalmente são usadas no início de expressões regulares. O padrão que elas definem é uma pré-condição para uma correspondência, apesar de não fazer parte do resultado correspondente..asserção lookbehind positiva de largura zeroYAs assinaturas de método relacionadas encontradas nos metadados não serão atualizadas.Comentários:.Não há suporte para a remoção do documentoRemover SupressãoRemover a Supressão {0}Remover o modificador 'async'Remover documento '{0}'Remover qualificaçãoRemova a referência a '{0}'.Remover separadoresRemover tag#Remover conversões desnecessáriasRemover variável não usada"Remover variáveis não utilizadasA remoção de {0} que acessou as variáveis ​​capturadas '{1}' e '{2}' declaradas em escopos diferentes requer o reinício do aplicativo.WRemover {0} que contém uma instrução ativa requer a reinicialização do aplicativo.Renomear arquivo para {0}Renomear tipo para {0}+Renomear {0} requer reiniciar o aplicativo.bRenomear {0} requer a reinicialização do aplicativo porque não há suporte para ele no runtime.^Renomear uma variável capturada de '{0}' para '{1}' requer a reinicialização do aplicativo.)Substituir "{0}" e "{1}" por propriedadesSubstituir '{0}' por '{1}'Substituir '{0}' com métodoSubstituir '{0}' com métodos$Substituir "{0}" por uma propriedadeqO diagnóstico relatado '{0}' tem um local de origem '{1}' no arquivo '{2}', que está fora do arquivo fornecido.zO diagnóstico relatado '{0}' tem um local de origem no arquivo '{1}', que não faz parte da compilação sendo analisada.DO analisador não dá suporte ao diagnóstico relatado com ID '{0}'.PRepresenta um objeto cujas operações serão resolvidas no tempo de execução.+Assembly solicitado já carregado de "{0}". Resolver marcadores de conflitosDevoluções:Roslyn.HostErrorEdição rudimentar*A seleção não contém um token válido.)Seleção não contida dentro de um tipo.Separar nibblesSeparar milharesSeparar palavrasSimplificar o Acesso de MembroSimplificar NomesSnippets	Solução+Classificar modificadores de acessibilidade*Dividir em instruções '{0}' consecutivas'Dividir em instruções '{0}' aninhadas?O fluxo deve fornecer suporte a operações de leitura e busca.

A operação de formatação ignorará o especificador se a data a ser formatada não tiver um período associado ou uma cadeia de caracteres de era.

Se o especificador de formato "g" for usado sem outros especificadores de formato personalizado, ele será interpretado como o especificador de formato padrão de data e hora "g".projeto {0}propriedadeacessador de propriedadevariável de intervalodata/hora rfc1123O especificador de formato padrão "R" ou "r" representa uma cadeia de caracteres de formato de data e hora personalizado definida pela propriedade DateTimeFormatInfo.RFC1123Pattern. O padrão reflete um padrão definido e a propriedade é somente leitura. Portanto, é sempre o mesmo, independentemente da cultura usada ou do provedor de formato fornecido. A cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado é "ddd, dd MMM yyyy HH':'mm':'ss 'GMT'". Quando esse especificador de formato padrão é usado, a operação de análise ou formatação sempre usa a cultura invariável."data/hora de viagem de ida e voltaO especificador de formato padrão "O" ou "o" representa uma cadeia de caracteres de formato de data e hora personalizado usando um padrão que preserva as informações de fuso horário e emite uma cadeia de resultado que está em conformidade com o ISO 8601. Para valores DateTime, esse especificador de formato é projetado para preservar valores de data e hora juntamente com a propriedade DateTime.Kind no texto. A cadeia de caracteres formatada poderá ser analisada novamente usando o método DateTime.Parse (String, IFormatProvider, DateTimeStyles) ou DateTime.ParseExact se o parâmetro styles estiver definido como DateTimeStyles.RoundtripKind.

O especificador de formato padrão "O" ou "o" corresponde à cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado "yyyy'-'MM'-'dd'T'HH':'mm':'ss'.'fffffffK" para valores DateTime e à cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado "yyyy'-'MM'-'dd'T'HH':'mm':'ss'.'fffffffzzz" para valores de DateTimeOffset. Nessa cadeia de caracteres, os pares de aspas simples que delimitam caracteres individuais, como hifens, dois-pontos e a letra "T", indicam que o caractere individual é um literal que não pode ser alterado. Os apóstrofos não aparecem na cadeia de caracteres de saída.

O especificador de formato padrão "O" ou "o" (e a cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado "yyyy'-'MM'-'dd'T'HH':'mm':'ss'.'fffffffK") aproveita as três maneiras pelas quais o ISO 8601 representa as informações de fuso horário para preservar a propriedade Kind dos valores DateTime: 

    O componente de fuso horário de DateTimeKind.Local dos valores de data e hora é uma diferença do UTC (por exemplo, +01:00, -07:00). Todos os valores de DateTimeOffset também são representados nesse formato. 

    O componente de fuso horário de DateTimeKind.Utc dos valores de data e hora usa "Z" (que significa diferença zero) para representar o UTC.

    Os valores de data e hora de DateTimeKind.Unspecified não especificados não têm informações de fuso horário.

Como o especificador de formato padrão "O" ou "o" está em conformidade com um padrão internacional, a operação de formatação ou análise que usa o especificador sempre usa a cultura invariável e o calendário gregoriano.

As cadeias de caracteres que são passadas para os métodos Parse, TryParse, ParseExact e TryParseExact de DateTime e DateTimeOffset podem ser analisadas usando o especificador de formato "O" ou "o" caso elas estejam em um desses formatos. No caso de objetos DateTime, a sobrecarga de análise que você chama também deve incluir um parâmetro styles com um valor de DateTimeStyles.RoundtripKind. Observe que, se você chamar um método de análise com a cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado que corresponde ao especificador de formato "O" ou "o", você não obterá os mesmos resultados de "O" ou "o". Isso porque os métodos de análise que usam uma cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado não podem analisar a representação de cadeia de caracteres dos valores de data e hora que não têm um componente de fuso horário ou usar "Z" para indicar o UTC.segundo (1-2 dígitos)O especificador de formato personalizado "s" representa os segundos como um número de 0 a 59. O resultado representa segundos inteiros que passaram desde o último minuto. Um segundo de dígito único é formatado sem um zero à esquerda.

Se o especificador de formato "s" for usado sem outros especificadores de formato personalizado, ele será interpretado como o especificador de formato de data e hora padrão "s".segundo (2 dígitos)O especificador de formato personalizado "ss" (mais qualquer número de especificadores "s" adicionais) representa os segundos como um número de 00 a 59. O resultado representa segundos inteiros que passaram desde o último minuto. Um segundo de dígito único é formatado com um zero à esquerda.data abreviadaO especificador de formato padrão "d" representa uma cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado de data e hora que é definida pela propriedade DateTimeFormatInfo.ShortDatePattern de uma cultura específica. Por exemplo, a cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado retornada pela propriedade ShortDatePattern da cultura invariável é "MM/dd/yyyy".hora abreviadaO especificador de formato padrão "t" representa uma cadeia de caracteres de formato de data e hora personalizada que é definida pela propriedade DateTimeFormatInfo.ShortTimePattern atual. Por exemplo, a cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado para a cultura invariável é "HH:mm".data/hora classificável
O especificador de formato padrão "s" representa uma cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado de data e hora que é definida pela propriedade DateTimeFormatInfo.SortableDateTimePattern. O padrão reflete um padrão definido (ISO 8601) e a propriedade é somente leitura. Portanto, é sempre o mesmo, independentemente da cultura usada ou do provedor de formato fornecido. A cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado é "yyyy'-'MM'-'dd'T'HH':'mm':'ss".

O objetivo do especificador de formato "s" é produzir cadeias de caracteres de resultado que são classificadas consistentemente em ordem crescente ou decrescente com base nos valores de data e hora. Como resultado, embora o especificador de formato padrão "s" represente um valor de data e hora em um formato consistente, a operação de formatação não modifica o valor do objeto de data e hora que está sendo formatado para refletir sua propriedade DateTime.Kind ou seu valor DateTimeOffset.Offset. Por exemplo, as cadeias de caracteres de resultado produzidas pela formatação dos valores de data e hora 2014-11-15T18:32:17+00:00 e 2014-11-15T18:32:17+08:00 são idênticas.

Quando esse especificador de formato padrão é usado, a operação de análise ou formatação sempre usa a cultura invariável.construtor estático&"símbolo" não pode ser um namespace.separador de hora	O especificador de formato personalizado ":" representa o separador de hora, que é usado para diferenciar horas, minutos e segundos. O separador de hora localizado apropriado é recuperado da propriedade DateTimeFormatInfo.TimeSeparator da cultura atual ou especificada.

Observação: para alterar o separador de hora de uma determinada cadeia de caracteres de data e hora, especifique o caractere separador em um delimitador de cadeia de caracteres literal. Por exemplo, a cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado hh'_'dd'_'ss produz uma cadeia de caracteres de resultado na qual "_" (um sublinhado) é sempre usado como o separador de hora. Para alterar o separador de hora para todas as datas para uma cultura, altere o valor da propriedade DateTimeFormatInfo.TimeSeparator da cultura atual ou crie uma instância de um objeto DateTimeFormatInfo, atribua o caractere à propriedade TimeSeparator e chame uma sobrecarga do método de formatação que inclui um parâmetro IFormatProvider.

Se o especificador de formato ":" for usado sem outros especificadores de formato personalizado, ele será interpretado como um especificador de formato padrão de data e hora e gerará uma FormatException.fuso horário
O especificador de formato personalizado "K" representa as informações de fuso horário de um valor de data e hora. Quando esse especificador de formato é usado com valores DateTime, a cadeia de caracteres de resultado é definida pelo valor da propriedade DateTime.Kind:

    Para o fuso horário local (um valor da propriedade DateTime.Kind de DateTimeKind.Local), este especificador é equivalente ao especificador "zzz" e produz uma cadeia de caracteres de resultado contendo o deslocamento local do UTC (Tempo Universal Coordenado); por exemplo, "-07:00".

    Para uma hora UTC (um valor de propriedade DateTime.Kind de DateTimeKind.Utc), a cadeia de caracteres de resultado inclui um caractere "Z" para representar uma data UTC.

    Para um horário de um fuso horário não especificado (uma hora cuja propriedade DateTime.Kind seja igual a DateTimeKind.Unspecified), o resultado é equivalente a String.Empty.

Para os valores de DateTimeOffset, o especificador de formato "K" é equivalente ao especificador de formato "zzz" e produz uma cadeia de caracteres de resultado contendo o deslocamento do valor de DateTimeOffset do UTC.

Se o especificador de formato "K" for usado sem outros especificadores de formato personalizado, ele será interpretado como um especificador de formato padrão de data e hora e gerará uma FormatException.tiporestrição de tipoparâmetro de tipodata/hora universal por extensoO especificador de formato padrão "U" representa uma cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado de data e hora que é definida pela propriedade DateTimeFormatInfo.FullDateTimePattern de uma cultura especificada. O padrão é o mesmo que o padrão "F". No entanto, o valor DateTime é convertido automaticamente para UTC antes de ser formatado."data/hora universal classificávelO especificador de formato padrão "u" representa uma cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado de data e hora que é definida pela propriedade DateTimeFormatInfo.UniversalSortableDateTimePattern. O padrão reflete um padrão definido e a propriedade é somente leitura. Portanto, é sempre o mesmo, independentemente da cultura usada ou do provedor de formato fornecido. A cadeia de caracteres de formato personalizado é "yyyy'-'MM'-'dd HH':'mm':'ss'Z'". Quando esse especificador de formato padrão é usado, a operação de análise ou formatação sempre usa a cultura invariável.

Embora a cadeia de caracteres de resultado deva expressar um horário como UTC (Tempo Universal Coordenado), nenhuma conversão do valor original DateTime é executada durante a operação de formatação. Portanto, você precisa converter um valor DateTime para UTC chamando o método DateTime.ToUniversalTime antes de formatá-lo.&atualizando os usos em contém membros.usos em que contém o projeto de atualização+usos em que contém o tipo de atualização&atualizar usos em projetos dependentesdiferença de hora e minuto UTCCom os valores DateTime, o especificador de formato personalizado "ZZZ" representa o deslocamento assinado do fuso horário do sistema operacional local do UTC, medido em horas e minutos. Ele não reflete o valor da propriedade DateTime.Kind de uma instância. Por esse motivo, o especificador de formato "ZZZ" não é recomendado para uso com valores DateTime.

Com os valores de DateTimeOffset, este especificador de formato representa o deslocamento do valor de DateTimeOffset do UTC em horas e minutos.

O deslocamento é sempre exibido com um sinal à esquerda. Um sinal de adição (+) indica horas à frente do UTC e um sinal de subtração (-) indica horas atrás do UTC. Um deslocamento de dígito único é formatado com um zero à esquerda.&diferença horária UTC (1-2 dígitos)Com valores DateTime, o especificador de formato personalizado "z" representa o deslocamento assinado do fuso horário do sistema operacional local do UTC (Tempo Universal Coordenado), medido em horas. Ele não reflete o valor da propriedade DateTime.Kind de uma instância. Por esse motivo, o especificador de formato "z" não é recomendado para uso com valores DateTime.

Com os valores de DateTimeOffset, este especificador de formato representa o deslocamento do valor de DateTimeOffset do UTC em horas.

O deslocamento é sempre exibido com um sinal à esquerda. Um sinal de adição (+) indica horas à frente do UTC e um sinal de subtração (-) indica horas atrás do UTC. Um deslocamento de dígito único é formatado sem um zero à esquerda.

Se o especificador de formato "z" for usado sem outros especificadores de formato personalizado, ele será interpretado como um especificador de formato padrão de data e hora e gerará uma FormatException.$diferença horária UTC (2 dígitos)Com valores DateTime, o especificador de formato personalizado "zz" representa o deslocamento assinado do fuso horário do sistema operacional local do UTC, medido em horas. Ele não reflete o valor da propriedade DateTime.Kind de uma instância. Por esse motivo, o especificador de formato "zz" não é recomendado para uso com valores DateTime.

Com os valores de DateTimeOffset, este especificador de formato representa o deslocamento do valor de DateTimeOffset do UTC em horas.

O deslocamento é sempre exibido com um sinal à esquerda. Um sinal de adição (+) indica horas à frente do UTC e um sinal de subtração (-) indica horas atrás do UTC. Um deslocamento de dígito único é formatado com um zero à esquerda. intervalo [x-y] em ordem inversaano (1-2 dígitos)O especificador de formato personalizado "y" representa o ano como um número de um ou dois dígitos. Se o ano tiver mais de dois dígitos, somente os dois dígitos de ordem baixa aparecerão no resultado. Se o primeiro dígito de um ano de dois dígitos começar com zero (por exemplo, 2008), o número será formatado sem um zero à esquerda.

Se o especificador de formato "y" for usado sem outros especificadores de formato personalizado, ele será interpretado como o especificador de formato padrão de data e hora "y".ano (2 dígitos)O especificador de formato personalizado "yy" representa o ano como um número de dois dígitos. Se o ano tiver mais de dois dígitos, somente os dois dígitos de ordem baixa aparecerão no resultado. Se o ano de dois dígitos tiver menos de dois dígitos significativos, o número será preenchido com zeros à esquerda para produzir dois dígitos.

Em uma operação de análise, um ano de dois dígitos analisado usando o especificador de formato personalizado "yy" é interpretado com base na Propriedade Calendar.TwoDigitYearMax do calendário atual do provedor de formato. O exemplo a seguir analisa a representação de cadeia de caracteres de uma data que tem um ano de dois dígitos usando o calendário gregoriano padrão da cultura en-US, que, neste caso, é a cultura atual. Em seguida, altera o objeto CultureInfo da cultura atual para usar um objeto GregorianCalendar cuja propriedade TwoDigitYearMax foi modificada.ano (3-4 dígitos)O especificador de formato personalizado "yyy" representa o ano com um mínimo de três dígitos. Se o ano tiver mais de três dígitos significativos, eles serão incluídos na cadeia de caracteres de resultado. Se o ano tiver menos de três dígitos, o número será preenchido com zeros à esquerda para produzir três dígitos.ano (4 dígitos)O especificador de formato personalizado "yyyy" representa o ano com um mínimo de quatro dígitos. Se o ano tiver mais de quatro dígitos significativos, eles serão incluídos na cadeia de caracteres de resultado. Se o ano tiver menos de quatro dígitos, o número será preenchido com zeros à esquerda para produzir quatro dígitos.ano (5 dígitos)O especificador de formato personalizado "yyyyy" (mais qualquer número de especificadores "y" adicionais) representa o ano com um mínimo de cinco dígitos. Se o ano tiver mais de cinco dígitos significativos, eles serão incluídos na cadeia de caracteres de resultado. Se o ano tiver menos de cinco dígitos, o número será preenchido com zeros à esquerda para produzir cinco dígitos.

Se houver especificadores "y" adicionais, o número será preenchido com quantos zeros à esquerda forem necessários para produzir o número de especificadores "y".mês do anoO especificador de formato padrão "Y" ou "y" representa uma cadeia de caracteres de formato de data e hora personalizado definida pela propriedade DateTimeFormatInfo.YearMonthPattern de uma cultura especificada.
